# A Window to the World of Neuro-Symbolic Artificial Intelligence: A Task-Directed Survey in the Black-Box Era
## Submitted at IJCAI 25 - Survey Track
This is a repository containing notes over the papers collected to write a survey on the world of Neuro-Symbolic (NeSy) approaches.

This query should be executed in the SPARQL endpoint of DBLP, or it can be run at the following link:

```

In order to explore further the intersection between Knowledge Graph Reasoning and NeSy, we run the following query:
```sparql

PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?paper ?title ?conference ?year
WHERE {
FILTER (year(?year) <= 2024 && year(?year) >= 2017) {
FILTER (REGEX(?conference, "^J. Mach. Learn. Res.$|^Int. J. Comput. Vis.$|^Trans. Assoc. Comput. Linguistics$|^ijcai$|^aaai$|^neurips$|^icml$|^iclr$|^ACL \\(\\d+|^emnlp$|^naacl-hlt$|^cvpr$|^iccv$|^eccv \\(\\d+","i")) {

  ?paper rdf:type dblp:Publication .
  ?paper dblp:title ?title .
  ?paper dblp:publishedIn ?conference .
  ?paper dblp:yearOfPublication ?year .
  FILTER (REGEX(?title, "neuro", "i") && REGEX(?title, "graph", "i")).
}}}}
ORDER BY DESC(?year)
```

Like in the above case, it can be executed at the following link:

Each folder contains the complete list of papers in the corresponding category, along with a link to the paperâ€™s page and a brief description of its content. 

Additionally, we provide a short explanation for exclusion from the survey.
